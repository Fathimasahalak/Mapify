Mapify üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Useless


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Fathima Sahala K - NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad
- Member 2: Girik Sagar - NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad


### Project Description
it shows actual routes between cities but pairs them with insulting fitness comments like "Go burn some calories! " or "Time to walk off those coconut laddus! " - giving you real directions while offensively demotivating you at the same time.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We're addressing the problem of navigation apps being too helpful

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our useless maps project satirically "solves" the issue of people becoming overly dependent on GPS navigation by creating an app that deliberately provides no useful assistance - instead giving dismissive responses, requiring users to ask adults for help, or insulting their fitness levels while showing routes, thus forcing people to think for themselves or seek human interaction rather than relying on technology.
